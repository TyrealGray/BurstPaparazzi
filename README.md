A background process really pisses you off?

Well,let's blow it up!

## For Example 
If you burst `TenioDL.exe` forever, TenioDL would show on the backups list and you will never see it run again 


## To begin coding
You need Everything SDK(`Everything32.dll`) and make sure `everything.exe` is running in background
